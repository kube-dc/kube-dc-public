## Overview

Kube-DC implements a multi-tenant access control system that combines:

- **Kubernetes RBAC**: Handles resource-level permissions within namespaces
- **Organization Groups**: Manages project-level access across namespaces
- **Keycloak Integration**: Provides user authentication and group management

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you're working from an **Organization Admin** perspective. You'll need:

- Access to the Kube-DC cluster with organization admin privileges
- `kubectl` configured to access your cluster with organization admin privileges
- Access to the Keycloak organization admin console

!!! tip "Before You Begin"
    During organization and project creation you will get a namespace with organization name `<orgname>` created and project namespace with `<orgname>-<projectname>` pattern.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Creating Project Roles

Create a Kubernetes Role to define permissions within a project namespace. These roles dictate what actions users can perform on specific resources.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: shalb-demo  # Replace with your project namespace
  name: resource-manager
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]  # "" indicates the core API group
    resources: ["pods", "services"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "create", "watch", "delete"]
  - apiGroups: ["apps"]
    resources: ["deployments", "daemonsets", "replicasets"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "create", "watch", "delete"]
```

Apply the role to your namespace using:

```bash
kubectl apply -f role.yaml
```

!!! warning "Role Scope"
    Remember that Roles are namespace-scoped. If you need permissions across multiple namespaces, you need to create a separate Role in each Project namespace.

### Creating Organization Groups

Create an OrganizationGroup Custom Resource (CR) to define group permissions across projects.

!!! important "Key Points"
    - The OrganizationGroup CR automatically creates a corresponding group in Keycloak
    - This CR **must be created in the organization namespace**, not the project namespace
    - Role bindings would be created by this CR

```yaml
apiVersion: kube-dc.com/v1
kind: OrganizationGroup
metadata:
  name: "app-manager"
  namespace: shalb  # namespace of the organization (not the project)
spec:
  permissions:
  - project: "demo"
    roles:
    - resource-manager
  # Additional projects and roles can be added:
  # - project: "prod"
  #   roles:
  #   - resource-manager
```

Apply the group configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f organization-group.yaml
```

### Managing Users in Keycloak

#### Access Keycloak Admin Console

Retrieve Keycloak access credentials from your organization namespace:

```bash
kubectl get secret realm-access -n shalb -o jsonpath='{.data.url}' | base64 -d
kubectl get secret realm-access -n shalb -o jsonpath='{.data.user}' | base64 -d
kubectl get secret realm-access -n shalb -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d
```

!!! tip "Remember"
    Replace `shalb` with your own organization namespace in the commands above.

#### Create and Configure Users

1. Log in to the Keycloak admin console using the retrieved credentials
2. Navigate to **Users â†’ Add User**
![Add User](images/keycloak-add-user.png)
3. Fill in the required user information
4. Set up initial password in the **Credentials** tab
5. Add the user to the appropriate group (e.g., "app-manager") via the **Groups** tab
![Join Group](images/keycloak-user-join-group.png)

!!! info "User Group Mapping"
    Any groups created via OrganizationGroup CRs will appear automatically in Keycloak. Changes to group membership in Keycloak are synchronized with Kubernetes RBAC.

### Accessing Kube-DC UI

1. Navigate to the Kube-DC UI login page
2. Log in using the credentials created in Keycloak
3. Verify access to assigned project resources

!!! tip "Permissions Troubleshooting"
    If a user cannot access expected resources:
    - Verify they're assigned to the correct groups in Keycloak
    - Check that the OrganizationGroup CR includes the correct projects and roles
    - Ensure the underlying Kubernetes Roles have appropriate permissions
    - Examine the Keycloak logs for authentication issues
    
    Permission changes may take up to 5 minutes to propagate through the system.
